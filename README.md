## Future Visions
[Survival of the Richest: The wealthy are plotting to leave us behind - Douglas Rushkoff](https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1)

[Moore's Law for Everything by Sam Altman](https://moores.samaltman.com/). 
  "My work at OpenAI reminds me every day about the magnitude of the socioeconomic change that is coming sooner than most people believe. Software that can think and learn will do more and more of the work that people now do. Even more power will shift from labor to capital. If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today. We need to design a system that embraces this technological future and taxes the assets that will make up most of the value in that world–companies and land–in order to fairly distribute some of the coming wealth. Doing so can make the society of the future much less divisive and enable everyone to participate in its gains."

 > If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. - Antoine de Saint-Exupery
